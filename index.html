    Organic produce is more expensive in stores because it is more challenging to grow food organically on a large scale. If you are tired of paying extra for fruits and vegetables that (hopefully) are pesticide and chemical-free, learn how to grow your own.
    Ever wonder why you tend to see the same varieties of produce at the grocery store? Mass production means growers choose fruit and vegetable varieties that quickly produce large yields and withstand shipping without bruising.
However, when you plant a garden, you choose the types of produce you grow based on flavor and texture (not how long it lasts before going bad). Glance through a seed catalog, and you’ll have your choice of dozens of different types of each vegetable.

    A garden can provide fruits and vegetables year-round, depending on where you live. Learn to preserve the excess through freezing, canning, and freeze-drying.
Plan your meals around what is growing in the garden, and you will learn to love the changing harvests throughout the year.
The wonderful thing about gardening is it is simple enough for a child to understand, but there is also more to learn than one person will ever master in a lifetime.
Knowing where your food comes from and how to grow it is empowering. Once you understand the basics and begin to have success, teach others what you have learned.
