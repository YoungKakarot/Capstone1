    Organic produce is more expensive in stores because it is more challenging to grow food organically on a large scale. If you are tired of paying extra for fruits and vegetables that (hopefully) are pesticide and chemical-free, learn how to grow your own.
    Ever wonder why you tend to see the same varieties of produce at the grocery store? Mass production means growers choose fruit and vegetable varieties that quickly produce large yields and withstand shipping without bruising.
However, when you plant a garden, you choose the types of produce you grow based on flavor and texture (not how long it lasts before going bad). Glance through a seed catalog, and youâ€™ll have your choice of dozens of different types of each vegetable.

    Once picked, the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables begins to decline.1 The short distance from the garden to your table ensures fewer nutrients are lost. In addition, vegetables left to ripen in the ground or on the vine often have more nutrients than those harvested earlier.
    You are in control of when food is harvested. Like your zucchini small? You can pick it at any size. Want a fresh juicy peach right off the tree? No problem (just get it before the birds do!).
Sugars in food begin turning to starch once picked. That is why asparagus, corn, peas, strawberries, and more all taste the best fresh-picked!

    A garden can provide fruits and vegetables year-round, depending on where you live. Learn to preserve the excess through freezing, canning, and freeze-drying.
Plan your meals around what is growing in the garden, and you will learn to love the changing harvests throughout the year.
The wonderful thing about gardening is it is simple enough for a child to understand, but there is also more to learn than one person will ever master in a lifetime.
Knowing where your food comes from and how to grow it is empowering. Once you understand the basics and begin to have success, teach others what you have learned.
